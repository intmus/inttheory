## Condensation Conversation 

**Important things to watch out for:**
- Changing clefs!
    - Remember that some instruments change clef when they transpose. For example, tenor sax is written in treble clef, but it sounds in bass clef.
    - Be sure to read instruments in alto and tenor clef correctly.
- Lining up beats
    - When you write out the different voices on the condensed score, be sure and line up all the note heads vertically throughout the treble and bass clef.
    - The location of the beats needs to be clear so that you can analyze the exerpt properly. IT IS A COMMON PITFALL FOR STUDENTS ON THE FINAL EXAM TO TRANSCRIBE THEIR CONDENSED SCORE SLOPPILY AND THUS FAIL TO ANALYZE IT CORRECTLY.
- Matching keys
    - Key signatures are the secret guide to transposing! Recall that key signatures get moved the same amount as notes during the transposition process. So, you can do some math by comparing the key signature of a transposing instrument with the key signature of a non-transposing instrument and deduce how much you need to move the notes of your transposing instrument. Just make sure you know which direction to move it!
    - Accidentals in the transposed key should match accidentals in the concert key. Remember, if a melody is diatonic in the original key, it will be diatonic in any key you transpose it to!
    - A trick that helps speed up the transposition process is to think of each line in solfege (or scale degrees). By translating am]n instrument line into a shape, you can apply that shape to any key.

**The Bari Trick:**
- A baritone saxophone is written in treble clef, but it sounds in bass clef.
- The written notes on a bari part always appear in the same location on the treble clef staff when transposed to concert pitch on the bass clef staff. They will occupy the same lines or spaces. So, you can simply leave all your notes in the same location when transposing!
- When transposing a bari part *into concert pitch*, you simply *add three flats* to the key signature to get the new key signature.
- When trasposing a bari part from concert pitch *into written pitch*, *add three sharps* to get the new key signature.
- WARNING: BE CAREFUL OF USING THIS TRICK IN HIGH SHARP OR HIGH FLAT KEYS! When your bari part crosses the threshold from a flat key signature to a sharp key signature when transposing, the trick FAILS.
