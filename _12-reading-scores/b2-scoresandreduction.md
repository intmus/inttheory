## Condensation Conversation 

**Important things to watch out for:**
- Changing clefs!
    - Remember that some instruments change clef when they transpose. For example, tenor sax is written in treble clef, but it sounds in bass clef.
    - Be sure to read instruments in alto and tenor clef correctly.
- Lining up beats
    - When you write out the different voices on the condensed score, be sure and line up all the note heads vertically throughout the treble and bass clef.
    - The location of the beats needs to be clear so that you can analyze the exerpt properly. IT IS A COMMON PITFALL FOR STUDENTS ON THE FINAL EXAM TO TRANSCRIBE THEIR CONDENSED SCORE SLOPPILY AND THUS FAIL TO ANALYZE IT CORRECTLY.
- Matching keys
    - Key signatures are the secret guide to transposing! Recall that key signatures get moved the same amount as notes during the transposition process. So, you can do some math by comparing the key signature of a transposing instrument with the key signature of a non-transposing instrument and deduce how much you need to move the notes of your transposing instrument.
