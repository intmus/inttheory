# Class Discussion

Asymmetric and irregular meters mean the same thing, but calling them "irregular" might make them easier to understand from the drop. An asymmetric/irregular meter is any meter where the beats have varying lengths, seen clearly in the first example where we proceed through 5/8, 7/8, and 8/8.

In ths first ex with the different x/8s, we can even do different groupings within these three time signatures.

**Do we still use notation from regular meters when we're in an irregular meter?** (simple meters tell length of beat, compound meters tell length of division)
- Irregular meters use the same rules as compound meters. This is because the division is the same in meters like 5/8 but the beats, by definition, are not the same

**Mixed meter**
- Mixing meters within the same piece!

**Polymeter**
- More than one meter happening at the same time. While mixed meter has everybody switching b/w meters together, polymeter has two or more groups playing in different meters simultaneously.

**Implied polymeter**
- What it says on the tin: the polymeter is not explicitly written in time signatures, but the way the music itself is written implies that it's happening anyway

**Polyrhythm**
- Unlike polymeter, which happens at the bar level, polyrhythm is the same concept happening at the beat level
