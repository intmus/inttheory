## Modulation Mania

**Modulation vs. Modal Movement**
- Modulation is a change in tonic
- Modal Movement is the same tonic, but with a new key signature

**Closely-related Keys**
- Every major and minor key whose key signature is within one accidental of the home key.
- Every home key has **five** closely related keys.
- Ex: F minor is closely relatd to Ab, C-, Eb, Bb-, and Db. This is becuase the key signature of F- is four flats. The key sig of Ab is also four flats. The key sig of C- and Eb is three flats (only one accidental different). Lastly, the key sig of Bb- and Db is five flats.

**How do you tell the difference between tonicization and modulation?**
- Usually, **tonicization is temporary**, while **modulation is monumental**.
- If a phrase ends in a new key, it is likely a modulation.
- If a phrase moves to a new key in the middle, but then ends in the home key, it is likely a case of tonicization.
- If a new key is emphasized with dominant-to-tonic motion more than once, it is likey a modulation.
- Ultimately, modulation is a subjective experience. As long as your explanation for tonicization or modulation is reasonable, it's correct.
