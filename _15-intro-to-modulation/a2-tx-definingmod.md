## Modulation Mania

**Modulation vs. Modal Movement**
- Modulation is a change in tonic
- Modal Movement is the same tonic, but with a new key signature

**Closely-related Keys**
- Every major and minor key whose key signature is within one accidental of the home key.
- Every home key has **five** closely related keys.
- Ex: F minor is closely relatd to Ab, C-, Eb, Bb-, and Db. This is becuase the key signature of F- is four flats. The key sig of Ab is also four flats. The key sig of C- and Eb is three flats (only one accidental different). Lastly, the key sig of Bb- and Db is five flats.

**How do you tell the difference between tonicization and modulation?**
- Signaling is the same for both: look for accidentals, namely raised notes (ti in the temporary/new key, fi in the current key)
- Placement: is the new key area happening at the end of a phrase or is it in the middle? Furthmore, what is *around* it? If we stay in the new key, we've modulated, but if it's temporary it's tonicization.
  - In the second example we listened to in class, we have a V/VI - VI progression to the first fermata. However, the chords after it are still in the key of I. This indicates that we haven't changed keys. If we had, the following chords wouldn't make as much sense in I because they're actually in the key of VI
- Ear training is vital. We talked about it a lot in class, but being able to follow *do* as it moves between keys will speed up the process of figuring out whether we're tonicizing or modulating
  - Be aware that the actual *look* of the music can be deceiving. In the Chopin example we went over in class, he starts tonicizing Bb major. Since the example is in G minor, Bb major's relative minor, putting in a V/III requires no accidentals. Hunting for accidentals is a good start for finding secondary dominants and/or modulations, but as with most theory things...it doesn't always work

If it establishes the new key it's a modulation. However, this requires multiple things: you have to have a cadence, and you have to stay in the new key. "Does the phrase feel solid and stable in a new key?" is a really subjective question, though, which is how arguments/debate arise.
