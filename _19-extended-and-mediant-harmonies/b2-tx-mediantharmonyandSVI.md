## Mediant Mania

**"What is mediant harmony?"**
- Chordal motion that involves root movement by thirds

**"Why use mediant harmony?"**
- It's a way to move to distant keys in very smooth ways
- It allows composers to have smooth voice leading while using interesting harmony


Ex: *Festive Overture* opening

### Simplified Voice-leading Intervals (SVI)
- This is a framework for measuring the amount of distance that voices move between chords
- You measure this by counting how many half steps each voice moves from one chord to the next, then totaling it up
- For example, a **G** major triad to a **C** major triad has an **SVI** value of **3**

**"Which chords have the lowest SVI?"**
- The ones that share two common tones.
- With mediant harmony, there is always some sharing of common tones, which is why we say the voice-leading is so smooth - because there is very little motion.


**In a tonal analysis** you can use SVI as a way to explain motion between chords. However, this can only be used if the music is actually written in a way where the notes are moving smoothly to each other. The chords cannot merely have a *theoretically* smooth relationship.
- You can label this in your analysis by writing "**SVI: _**" between the roman numerals




### SVI In C Major and Parallel Minor



1. C to Dm - SVI:5

2. C to Do - SVI:4

3. C to Eb - SVI:3

4. C to Em - SVI:1

5. C to Fm - SVI:2

6. C to F - SVI:3

7. C to Gm - SVI:4

8. C to G - SVI:3

9. C to Ab - SVI:2

10. C to Am - SVI:2

11. C to Bb - SVI:5

12. C to Bo - SVI:4



We are left with (in C) Eb, Em, Ab, Am. 

We have 4 more mediant harmony chords, and they come from changing the quality of the previous chords.

- Ebm, E, Abm, A.

In total we have 4 chromatic mediant chords (Ebm, Eb, Em, E) and 4 chromatic submediant chords (Abm, Ab, Am, A).



**Diatonic mediants: the two mediants that are in the key.**

- In C major, Em and Am.

- your diatonic mediants always have 2 common tones and opposite chord qualities.



**Chromatic mediants: the 4 mediants that are borrowed from the parallel minor and the opposite chord quality of the diatonic mediants.**

- In C major, Eb, Ab, E, and A.

- Eb and Ab are from the parallel minor while the E and A are opposite chord qualities of diatonic mediants. 



**Doubly chromatic mediants: the 2 mediants that are not in the key, but are the opposite chord qualities of the parallel minor mediants.**

- In C major, Ebm and Abm.



You find the first 4 mediants by using the diatonic and chromatic mediants (the 2 from major and 2 from the parallel minor).
