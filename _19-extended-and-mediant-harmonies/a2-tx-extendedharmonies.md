## Extension Convention

**"When do we know that something is extended harmony?"**
- If a pitch can be explained away as a Non-Chord Tone, that is the best option.
- If a pitch is crucial for the melody, heavily emphasized, or can't be explained any other way, then it must be functional.
- Something is considered an extension when it can fit in to a stack of thirds beyond the seventh.

### Nomenclature:

In tertian harmony (based on stacks of thirds), the extended tones are **9ths**, **11ths**, and **13ths**. 

When labeling with lead-sheet, these numbers are assumed to represent diatonic intervals (in terms of major) above the root.
However, **the 7th requires special indications**.

**G<sup>9</sup>**
- A letter and number on its own implies a *dominant seventh*
- This chord would be spelled: G, B, D, F, A

**Gmaj<sup>9</sup>** or **G∆<sup>9</sup>**
- The maj/∆ is required to indicates a *major seventh*. This does not affect the quailty of the 9. The 9 is still assumed to be diatonic
- This would be spelled: G, B, D, F<sup>#</sup>, A

**G<sup>11</sup>** or **G<sup>13</sup>**
- Like with the 9, these chord will include a *dominant seventh*
- Many players will also assume that the *9 is included*!
- So, these would be spelled:
- G<sup>11</sup>: G, B, D, F, A, C
- G<sup>13</sup>: G, B, D, F, A, (C), E

**Altered Extensions:**
- To alter the quality of an extension, you separate it from the 7 like this: **G<sup>7</sup><sup>(<sup>b</sup>9)</sup>**
- This would be spelled: G, B, D, F, A<sup>b</sup>
- Other common altered extensions include: **G<sup>7</sup><sup>(<sup>#</sup>11)</sup>**, **G<sup>7</sup><sup>(<sup>b</sup>13)</sup>**, or **G<sup>7</sup><sup>(<sup>#</sup>13)</sup>**

**Isolated Extensions**:
- If you don't have a seventh, but you do have higher extensions, you can leave the 7 out of you lead sheet like this:
- **G <sup>add 9</sup>** or **G <sup>add <sup>#</sup>11</sup>**

**Minor**:
- The same rules for sevenths and extensions apply to minor chords. The only change is that the triads are minor.
- Since leadsheet is not based of the key signature, *all extensions are assumed to be major intervals* above the root.

**Roman Numerals**:
- these ***are*** based on the key signature
- extensions are labeled differently because of this
- they are labeled with "(add)"

**Examples:**
- **G<sup>9</sup>** in the key of C major is **V<sup>7(add9)</sup>**
- **G<sup>7</sup><sup>(<sup>b</sup>9)</sup>** in the key of C major is **V<sup>7(add<sup>b</sup>9)</sup>**
- **G<sup>9</sup>** in the key of C minor is **V<sup>7(add<sup>#</sup>9)</sup>**
- **G<sup>7</sup><sup>(<sup>b</sup>9)</sup>** in the key of C minor is **V<sup>7(add9)</sup>**
- Inversion: **G<sup>9</sup>/B** in the key of C major is **V<sup>6/5(add9)</sup>**
