title: 19a Discussion - Extended Tertian Harmonies and Non-chord Tones
abc: true
---

**"When do we know that something is extended harmony?"**
- If a pitch can be explained away as a Non-Chord Tone, that is the best option.
- If a pitch is crucial for the melody, heavily emphasized, or can't be explained any other way, then it must be functional.
- Something is considered an extension when it can fit in to a stack of thirds beyond the seventh.

**Nomenclature:**

In tertian harmony (based on stacks of thirds), the extended tones are **9ths**, **11ths**, and **13ths**. 

When labeling with lead-sheet, these numbers are assumed to represent diatonic intervals above the root.

Labeled G9, G11, and G13 (for dominant chords).
  - G9 is G,B,D,F,A
  - G11 is G,B,D,F,A,C
  - G13 is G,B,D,F,A,C,E
  

If you have what looks like a G7, and you see an A, but it doesn't fit into any of these non-chord tone motion options, you have a G9.

### Dominant Ninth Chords
What are the differences between these chords?
1. V<sup>9</sup>
  - when you have just a 9 next to the V, it includes all the triadic tones up to the ninth. 
  - in C, spelled G,B,D,F,A.
2. V<sup>add9</sup>
  - "add" means to add a note to the triadic harmony, in this case, you're adding the 9th.
  - in C, spelled G,B,D,A.
  - also often grouped like G,A,B,D.
    - this is not the same as sub. 
    - sub means to substitute a chord tone with the given note.
3. V<sup>9 6/5</sup>
  - still spelled like a V9 but in first inversion (of seventh chord inversions).
    - if the ninth is on the bottom, it's probably not a ninth, but a pedal tone.
4. V<sup>sub13</sup>
  - sub effects a chord tone, while add doesn't.
  - though spelled the same as a iii6, it functions as the dominant so it is labelled Vsub13 (or Vsub6).
  - in C, spelled G,B,E.
  
A V<sup>9</sup> chord is the combination of a V7 and a G#%7. 
In A, the lower 4 notes are E,G#,B,D (V7). 
The upper 4 notes are G#,B,D,F#.
  - when spelling dominant extentions use the diatonic scale degrees in the key of the tonic. 

**ALL OF THIS BEING SAID,** the ninth chord is a last resort. 
It is rare in the type of music that this system of tonal analysis was created to analyze.
Extentions are used mainly for jazz, which is far out of our fixed system of analysis. 

Whether you analyze a tone as an extention or non-chord tone is up to how you hear it. 
Just make sure you label the tone to match what your analysis says. 

In the case of a b9, (in A minor) the chord symbol would be a E7(b9).
In the roman numeral analysis you would write V9, because the b9 is naturally occuring in the key.
It is altered in the parallel major (how we label dominant extentions) so it is labelled as E7(b9) in chord symbols.
