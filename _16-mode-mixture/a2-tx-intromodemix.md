## Mixing it Up

**Simple definition of Mode Mixture:**
- Replacing a diatonic chord with a chord from a parallel mode that shares the same function.
- Ex: replacing ii7 with iiø7
- *Modal interchange* and *borrowed harmony* are synonymous with mode mixture

**"Which diatonic chords are the same between parallel major and minor modes?"**
- The V and viiº chords are the same, becuase regardless of the key signature, V and viiº need to serve dominant function.

**"How do you get mode mixture to sound good?"**
- Smooooooooth voice-leading is key. Chromatic lines will sound good to the ear even if they move through weird chords.

**Common Themes of Mode Mixture:**
- It is more common to borrow chords from the parallel minor mode when you are in major than vice versa.
- The six chord is the most commonly altered one.
- Borrowing the flat two chord (from phrygian) while in major is so common that it has its own name: a *"Neapolitan"* chord.
- The reason borrowed chords are used is often to create smooth, interesting bass lines. For example: using a La, Ti, Do bassline in minor.
- Since the V and V7 chords are the same in both major and minor modes, you cannot borrow them. However, you can change between viiø7 and viiº7 chords.
