**"What mode is the Neapolitan chord borrowed from?"**
- Phyrgian
- The solfege is: Ra, Fa, Le

**Voicing Secrets:**
- The best chord tone to double is the third, because the other two notes in the Neapolitan chord are really strong tendency tones. **This is why Neapolitan chords are almost always in first inversion, so that the third is in the bass and has more freedom to move where it pleases.**
- Going from a N6 chord to a cadential 6/4 sounds good, because the bII chord tone can resolve down by a half step to I.
- Conversely, if you go from a N6 to a V chord of some kind, the bII has to resolve in a way that isn't as smooth.
- N6 chords function most similarly to iv chords, because they are spelled similary and resolve similarly.
- N6 chords are mostly used as predominant function. However, a N6 chord *can* have dominant function, but the resolution will likely have lots of objectional parallels.
 
*Another chord that the bII chord can move to is the IVM7(#11) because of very smooth voiceleading.  <- (hip)
