- **11a**
    - 12.5.I.B-F
        - For contextual analysis, simply label each chordâ€™s function: (i.e. tonic, dominant, pre-dominant)
        - You may not alter the bass line indicated by the Roman numerals.
        - When "changing the voicing" on repeated harmonies, you cannot prioritize stepwise motion and stay within the harmony. Simply move one or more chord tones to another chord tone.
    - 13.1.I.d-h
        - Follow *all* of the instructions.
    - 15.3.II.A
- **11b**
    - 13.3.II.(b) and (d) only
        - You do not need to do (c).
        - For the 4/3 chord in (b), consider this a passing chord. This means that it is simply connecting the i chord to the i<sup>6</sup> and will have all stepwise or static motion.
    - 13.4.II
