- **6b**
    - 11.1.II
        - Pay careful attention to Step #5 in the instructions. I and V chords (and their inversions) are your only options.
        - Be mindful of the key signatures.
        - Make sure to play your examples back using a keyboard. Your ear will catch most mistakes.
    - 11.2.I.A
        - Same as above. Only I and V chords (and their inversions) will be accepted.
        - Remember that the seventh scale degree must be raised in minor.
    - 11.4.I
        - You may ignore question (b). This question is poorly constructed, and would require a VI<sup>M6/5</sup> as a correct answer that incorporates E-flat as a chord tone.
    - 11.4.II
- **6c**
    - 12.1.II
    - 12.2.I

            - See cadence abbreviations below.
    - 13.5.II
