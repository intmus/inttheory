    - 26.1.III
        - You may ignore the questions below the analysis.
        - The bass line has multiple NCT passing tones, some of which are chromatic. Do not let this change your harmony unnecessarily.
        - "Modal scale degrees" means pitches borrowed from the parallel mode.
    - 26.3.I
    - 26.3.III
        - Analyze the passage and answer question (b). You do not need to answer question (a).
        - Remember to label the function of any chords that don't fulfill their primary diatonic function (e.g. passing, pedal, cadential, etc.)
    - 26.4.A
        - Measures 5-7 can be analyzed as a sequence or a brief modulation. 
            - A sequence will rely on mode mixture. 
            - If you choose to use a modulation, make sure to label correctly for the type of modulation that you choose. (Hint: It's not a pivot of any kind.) Measure 8 will need to return to C minor.
    - 26.4.B
        - Double-check that your Roman numerals match your leadsheet symbols.
