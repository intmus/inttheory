## Savvy Sevenths

**Pedagogical Seventh Chord Labels:**
- Major seventh: MM (Major Major)
- Dominant seventh: Mm (Major minor)
- Minor seventh: mm (minor minor)
- Half-diminished seventh: dm (diminished minor)
- Fully-diminished seventh: dd (diminished diminished)
- *The first letter is the quality of the triad, the second letter is the quality of the interval from the root to the seventh.*

**Inversion Figures for Pedagogical Labels:**
- Root position: 7
- First inversion: 6/5
- Second inversion: 4/3
- Third inversion: 4/2

**Leadsheet Notation**
- Leadsheet notation is a system of labeling chords based on the written notes. Unlike Roman Numeral analysis, leadsheet is unreliant on the key.
- Each chord should have the letter name, quality of chord, seventh notation (if needed), and inversion figure (if needed).
- ALL CHORD LABELS USE CAPITAL LETTERS, NOT JUST MAJOR CHORDS
- Labeling triads:
  - Augmented: label "aug" or "+" after chord letter name
  - Major: nothing extra after chord letter name
  - Minor: "min", "m", or "-"
  - Diminished: "dim", "d", or a superscript "o"
- Labeling seventh chords:
  - Major seventh chord: write "maj7" after the letter, or "∆7", or just "∆"
  - Dominant seventh chord: superscript 7, nothing else
  - Minor seventh chord: "min7", "m7", or "-7"
  - Half-diminished seventh chord: "ø7"
  - Fully-diminished seventh chord: "o7"
- Labeling inversions:
  - To label inversions, put a diagonal slash after the chord symbol, then put the bass note under the slash. This is called a "slash chord".

### Seventh chords

A four-note chord whose pitch classes can be arranged as thirds is called a *seventh chord*.

Like with a triad, the pitch classes belonging to a seventh chord occupy adjacent positions (a four-pitch-class clump) on the circle of thirds. The four members of a seventh chord are the *root*, *third*, *fifth*, and *seventh*.

There are five qualities of seventh chords that appear in diatonic music: major seventh, dominant seventh, minor seventh, diminished seventh (also called fully-diminished), and half-diminished seventh. They are comprised of the following intervals above their roots:

-   major seventh: M3, P5, and M7 above the root (or major triad with a major seventh)
-   dominant seventh: M3, P5, and m7 above the root (or major triad with a minor seventh)
-   minor seventh: m3, P5, and m7 above the root (or minor triad with a minor seventh)
-   diminished seventh: m3, d5, and d7 above the root (or diminished triad with a diminished seventh)
-   half-diminished seventh: m3, d5, and m7 above the root (or diminished triad with a minor seventh)

Following are the lead-sheet abbreviations for seventh-chord qualities:

-   major seventh: maj7 or △7 (G<sup>maj7</sup> or G<sup>△7</sup>)
-   dominant seventh: 7 (B<sup>7</sup>)
-   minor seventh: m7 (F&#9839;<sup>m7</sup>)
-   diminished seventh: dim7 or °7 (D<sup>dim7</sup> or D<sup>°7</sup>)
-   half-diminished seventh: ⦰7 (A<sup>⦰7</sup>)
