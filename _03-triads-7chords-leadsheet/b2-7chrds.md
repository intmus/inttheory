### Seventh chords

A four-note chord whose pitch classes can be arranged as thirds is called a *seventh chord*.

Like with a triad, the pitch classes belonging to a seventh chord occupy adjacent positions (a four-pitch-class clump) on the circle of thirds. The four members of a seventh chord are the *root*, *third*, *fifth*, and *seventh*.

There are five qualities of seventh chords that appear in diatonic music: major seventh, dominant seventh, minor seventh, diminished seventh (also called fully-diminished), and half-diminished seventh. They are comprised of the following intervals above their roots:

-   major seventh: M3, P5, and M7 above the root (or major triad with a major seventh)
-   dominant seventh: M3, P5, and m7 above the root (or major triad with a minor seventh)
-   minor seventh: m3, P5, and m7 above the root (or minor triad with a minor seventh)
-   diminished seventh: m3, d5, and d7 above the root (or diminished triad with a diminished seventh)
-   half-diminished seventh: m3, d5, and m7 above the root (or diminished triad with a minor seventh)

Following are the lead-sheet abbreviations for seventh-chord qualities:

-   major seventh: maj7 or △7 (G<sup>maj7</sup> or G<sup>△7</sup>)
-   dominant seventh: 7 (B<sup>7</sup>)
-   minor seventh: m7 (F&#9839;<sup>m7</sup>)
-   diminished seventh: dim7 or °7 (D<sup>dim7</sup> or D<sup>°7</sup>)
-   half-diminished seventh: ⦰7 (A<sup>⦰7</sup>)
