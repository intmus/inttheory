title: Lesson 8a - Phrases and Cadences

---

When we perform a harmonic analysis, we are attempting to explain how a listener *hears* a harmonic progression. We identify which pitches are essential to the music and which are decorative--at least to a majority of listeners--by relying on a culturally-conditioned assumption: what does "good" music sound like? Our understanding of diatonic tendencies and voice-leading results from our emersion in the musical soup into which we are born, and this creates a shared language that can explain likely interpretations of a listener.

Once we go beyond looking at the building blocks of Western music--rhythm, intervals, chords, keys, etc.--and begin combining these concepts to analyze function, we start to organize music into structures that transform these individual ideas into complete musical statements. 

A *motive* (or *motif*) is the smallest identifiable fragment of music. It can be a short melodic fragment, a short harmonic progression, a distinct rhythm, or a combination of these things. A composer can take a motive and build an entire work around it through various transformations, but it will always retain some fundamental relationships of pitch, rhythm, or both.

A *phrase* is the complete musical idea built to expand and combine motives. A common analogy in music theory is to describe a phrase as a "musical sentence". A good sentence has a clear beginning, middle, and end. It has a few required structures and often some decorative parts to provide interest and detail. This is exactly how a musical phrase works. It has a clear beginning, middle, and end; it has required structures to define its function; and it can be manipulated, decorated, and transformed to relate to the ideas that surround it. Phrases can sometimes be divided into *sub-phrases*, but these sub-phrases do not function independently; instead, sub-phrases are best thought of as motives with support.

## Identifying phrases by ear

Music listeners instinctively separate musical ideas into phrases and how those ideas interact to form the larger structure of a work. Before we dive into the technical details of how we define a phrase, let's take a moment to demonstrate your natural ability to classify musical ideas in this way.

- Listen multiple times to *An Die Freude*, a simple, 2-voice composition written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart when he was a child.
- As you listen, note the beginning and ending of each phrase based solely on your listening. 
  - Remember that each phrase should sound like a complete musical idea with a clear beginning, middle, and end.
- Once you feel that you can comfortably identify the phrases, take a moment to assess *how* you were able to do this? Was it your growing knowledge of music theory? Or was it an ability that you developed before starting this course?

## Conclusions

You were likely able to hear each phrase with minimal effort. You can start by checking your answers against the following list:

For most, you probably identified that there is a strong melodic component in defining each phrase, which includes visually obvious clues such as the notated rest in the top line at the end of each phrase. Beyond that, however, there is an easy-to-identify quality that begins and ends each phrase that can be difficult to describe. Perhaps even more surprisingly, you can remove the melodic line and listen only to the bass line, and you will still be able to clearly hear the implied phrases.

The bass line for this removes rhythmic variety and melodic decorations entirely, showing that there is an implied harmonic element that defines phrasing. *Cadences* are this "missing link" that unites harmonic function to phrase structure.

## Cadences and function

Before we formally define cadences, let's quickly review our terminology of function from the previous units. After having developed voice-leading procedures in Unit 7a, you should now understand how the voice-leading between V and I contributes toward tension and release. This progression defines tonal harmony, and it is from this that we derive our three **primary functions**: tonic, dominant, and pre-dominant. While it is easy to memorize which chords belong to each of the primary functions, it is more important to understand how and why these functions work, because context can change a chord's function to any other function.
- *Tonic* - Tonic function chords provide stability and closure. Most chords that do this contain the tonic pitch, hence the name.
- *Dominant* - Dominant function chords pull strongly to *tonic* function chords. Their pull creates instability, but because they are only one chord removed from the end of the progression, most listeners will still associate them strongly with the end of a musical idea. The dominant chord can be considered the progenitor of this function, so all harmonies that pull to a tonic function can be described as a having a dominant function.
- *Pre-dominant* - Because the dominant function chord precedes the tonic function, the dominant function can be seen as the "doorway" through which all chords will pass as they move toward harmonic resolution. Therefore, all chords that have the goal of moving toward the dominant function are labeled as *pre-dominant* function. This will include a wide variety of chords, and when we introduce secondary and tertiary function chords later in the course, there will be a large amount of overlap between pre-dominant chords--a primary function--and those. We will discuss the implied semantics of primary, secondary, and tertiary chords as we learn them.

### Terminology confusion

Note that the two first primary functions--tonic and dominant--share terms with the older scale degree system (i.e. The system that we discussed in Unit 2a that uses terms such as mediant, submediant, supertonic, etc.) as well as certain commonly-used chord types such as dominant chords. Because students often confuse the meaning of these, this text will use the following style guide:
- When referring to scale degrees, I will always use the numbering system. (e.g. ^1, ^2, etc. OR "first scale degree", "second scale degree")
- When referring to harmonic function, I will always follow the terms "tonic" and "dominant" with the word "function".
- When referring to chords, I will use Roman numerals when possible. For example, rather than saying the dominant chord, I will refer to the V chord.

## What is a cadence?

The three primary harmonic functions of tonic, dominant, and pre-dominant shape all musical phrases through tension and resolution, and no where is that more obvious than in studying how phrases end. A *cadence* is the harmonic progression at the end of a musical phrase. All cadences finish a phrase, but not all cadences provide closure and stability. In fact, some cadences are purposefully unsettled.

We will study the chords associated with classifying cadences, but as we studied above, it takes far more than a specific set of chords to create a cadence. Some of the most common cadences conclude with V resolving to I, but not all progressions that include V to I are cadences. In addition to chord progressions, cadences are affected by melodic shapes, melodic rhythm, harmonic rhythm, context, meter, and many other elements of music.

For this course, we will study five types of cadences:
- *perfect authentic cadence (PAC)*
- *imperfect authentic cadence (IAC)*
- *half cadence (HC)*
- *deceptive cadence (DC)*
- *plagal cadence (PC)*

*Take special care to remember the abbreviations in parentheses for each cadence type. These will be used repeatedly in your analyses.*

## Identifying cadences

For each cadence in the following examples, determine:
- what chord progressions are associated with each type of cadence.
    - *perfect authentic cadence*
    - *imperfect authentic cadence*
    - *half cadence*
    - *deceptive cadence*
    - *plagal cadence*
- what chord functions (i.e. tonic, dominant, pre-dominant) are used in each type of cadence.
- what chord tones are present in the soprano and bass.
- what other musical elements affect the phrase ending.

*Note: I have elongated each fermata note to a rhythmic value outside of the time signature to give you more time to hear the cadence.*

## Conclusions

Cadences close each musical idea and phrase, and we classify each cadence by certain characteristics of their voice-leading and harmonic progressions.

- **Authentic Cadence** - any cadence in which a dominant function harmony (i.e. V or vii<sup>o</sup>) resolves to I. There are two types of authentic cadences, so we always label any authentic cadence as one of these: 
    - **Perfect Authentic Cadence (PAC)**
        - Must have a V chord resolving to a I/i chord
        - Both the V chord and I/i chord are in root position
        - `Do` is in the soprano voice of the I/i chord 
    - **Imperfect Authentic Cadence (IAC)**
        - Any authentic cadence that does not fulfill all of the requirements for a PAC.
- **Half Cadence (HC)**
    - Any phrase that ends on a V chord.
- **Plagal Cadence (PC)**
    - Any phrase that ends in IV resolving to I
        - Commonly associated with "Amen" at the end of chorales
- **Deceptive Cadence (DC)**
    - Any phrase that ends with V resolving to vi/VI

### Phrygian half cadence

There is a special type of half cadence that is used often enough in certain musical styles that it has received a special name: the *Phrygian half cadence (PHC)*. This cadence only occurs in minor and must consist of a iv<sup>6</sup> resolving to a root-position V chord. We will not discuss this particular cadence often, but you should be aware of it and able to label it when you see it.

## Using cadences to better understand phrasing

Now that we have a basic understanding of harmonic progressions, harmonic function, labeling function with Roman numerals, and *cadences*, we can combine these ideas to explore musical phrases. 
- Listen to *An Die Freude* below to refresh your memory, and make sure that you have clearly noted the beginnings and ends of all phrases. 
- Label the last two chords of each phrase using Roman numerals and inversion figures.
  - In your two-chord analyses, **please ignore all four pitches labeled as "NCT".** There are a few pitches which are not part functionally part of the chords in these cadences, so you should exclude them from your analysis. We will discuss non-chord tones in detail in the following unit.
- Do each of your phrase endings fit one of the cadences discussed in Unit 7c? If so, label the cadence below the Roman numerals.
- Identify at least one motive and describe what are defining characteristics of the motive. Rhythm? Specific intervals? Repeated progressions?
- Find multiple iterations of your motive. How does Mozart transform it throughout the piece?
- Once you have completed each of these steps, discuss what you think defines a phrase. What are the essential components?

Because this piece only has two voices, many chords will have more than one option for a harmony, so you must use the harmonic flowchart and you knowledge of cadences from Unit 7a to choose the most likely harmony based on function. For example, if a harmony only has `mi` and `sol`, this could be either a I chord or a iii chord. If you put it into context, however, it will become clear what harmony the listener is likely to hear. If the harmony with `mi` and `sol` is preceded by `fa` and `sol`, it is highly *unlikely* that this is a iii chord, because `fa` and `sol` outline a V<sup>7</sup> harmony and a V chord will not resolve to a iii chord. Instead the listener will hear this as a V chord resolving to a I chord--albeit an unstable I chord.

**NOTE: This piece has multiple modulations that I have marked into the score. We will cover modulations in a later unit, but for now, make sure to analyze each phrase ending in the correct key. If you do not, your cadences will not make sense.**

## Conclusions

After combining all of your discussions, your definition of a phrase should include is a complete musical idea that:
- has a clear sense of harmonic progression.
- ends with a cadence.
- has a melodic structure that creates tension and release.
- has a contour with a clear climax (high or low point).
- most often ends with longer rhythmic values to create a sense of pause or rest.
- reflects the natural tendencies of a sung line including places where a performer would breathe.
