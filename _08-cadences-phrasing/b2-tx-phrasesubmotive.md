title: Discussion 8b - The Phrase, Sub-phrase, and Motive
---

## Class Discussion

Often, phrases will end with a cadence. Cadences give balance ans structure to a piece of music. 

Things to look for when considering what might be a phrase:

- Cadences/resolutions

- Rests after a melody line

- Going into a different key/modulation

- Contour of the melody

Motives

- A motive is the smallest identifiable fragment of music.

## Identifying Phrases ##
- Look for rests
- Listen for a clear beginning, middle, and end.
- Look for cadential chords; I, V, and vi. A cadence is like the period at the end of a sentence.
- Look for structure. Sometimes, phrases stay the same length, and this can make it a lot easier to separate the different phrases.
