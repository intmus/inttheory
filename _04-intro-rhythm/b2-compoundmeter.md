## Compound Conundrum

**"What is a compound meter?"**
- Any regular meter where the beats are dvided evenly by 3. 

**Single, duple, triple, and quadruple refer to how many beats are in the measure. Ex:**
- Single: 3/8
- Duple: 6/8
- Triple: 9/8, 9/16
- Quadruple: 12/8

**"How do compound time signatures work?"**
- Top # = how many divisons there are in a measure.
- Bottom # = the note value of the division.
- Do figure out the number of beats in a measure, divide the top number by 3. (Ex: 6/8 has two beats. 6÷3=2)

**Counting:**
- Divisions: use "1 **la li** 2 **la li**"
- Subdivisions: use "1 **to** la **ta** li **ti** 2 **to** la **ta** li **ti**"

### Compound meters

Meters that divide the beat into three equal parts are *compound meters*. 

When combined with simple meters, there are six types of standard meter in Western music:

- simple duple (beats group into two, divide into two)
- simple triple (beats group into three, divide into two)
- simple quadruple (beats group into four, divide into two)
- compound duple (beats group into two, divide into three)
- compound triple (beats group into three, divide into three)
- compound quadruple (beats group into four, divide into three)

In a time signature, the *top number* (and the top number only!) describes the type of meter. Following are the top numbers that always correspond to each type of meter:

- simple duple: 2
- simple triple: 3
- simple quadruple: 4
- compound duple: 6
- compound triple: 9
- compound quadruple: 12

### Notating meter

In *compound meters*, the bottom number of the time signature corresponds to the type of note corresponding to *a single division of the beat*. If a compound meter is notated such that each dotted-quarter note corresponds to a beat, the eighth note is the division of the beat, and thus the bottom number of the time signature is 8. If a compound meter is notated such that each dotted-half note corresponds to a beat, the quarter note is the division of the beat, and thus the bottom number of the time signature is 4. Note that because the beat is divided into three in a compound meter, the beat is always three times as long as the division note, and *the beat is always dotted*.
