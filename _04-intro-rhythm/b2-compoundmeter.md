## Class Discussion 

Compound Meter

- A commpound meter is any meter where the beat is divided into 3 equal parts. 

- In compound meter, the time signature works differently than in simple meter. The top number tells you the number of divisions in the measure. To find the number of beats in a measure of compound time, take the top number and divide it by three.

Counting in Compound

- The subdivisions of the beat are counted "1 to la ti li ti". 

When determining whether something is simple or compound, it is important to consider the tempo of the piece. For example, a piece could be in simple triple or compound triple depending on how fast it is conducted.

## Class Discussion 2021

**What is a compound meter?**
- Any regular meter where beats are divisible by 3. 

**Duple triple, and quadruple all mean the same thing they do in simple meters. As for examples:**
- Duple: 6/8, 6/4, 6/2
-Triple: 9/8, 9/16
-Quadruple: 12/8, 12/4

**What do the top and bottom numbers of compound time signatures mean?**
- *Top = how many divisons there are in a measure*
- *Bottom = the note value of the division*

**Counting sixtupelets or the equivalent thereof**
-1 to la ta li ti 2 to la ta li ti
-For the purpose of having a different syllables on each note

### Compound meters

Meters that divide the beat into three equal parts are *compound meters*. 

When combined with simple meters, there are six types of standard meter in Western music:

- simple duple (beats group into two, divide into two)
- simple triple (beats group into three, divide into two)
- simple quadruple (beats group into four, divide into two)
- compound duple (beats group into two, divide into three)
- compound triple (beats group into three, divide into three)
- compound quadruple (beats group into four, divide into three)

In a time signature, the *top number* (and the top number only!) describes the type of meter. Following are the top numbers that always correspond to each type of meter:

- simple duple: 2
- simple triple: 3
- simple quadruple: 4
- compound duple: 6
- compound triple: 9
- compound quadruple: 12

### Notating meter

In *compound meters*, the bottom number of the time signature corresponds to the type of note corresponding to *a single division of the beat*. If a compound meter is notated such that each dotted-quarter note corresponds to a beat, the eighth note is the division of the beat, and thus the bottom number of the time signature is 8. If a compound meter is notated such that each dotted-half note corresponds to a beat, the quarter note is the division of the beat, and thus the bottom number of the time signature is 4. Note that because the beat is divided into three in a compound meter, the beat is always three times as long as the division note, and *the beat is always dotted*.
