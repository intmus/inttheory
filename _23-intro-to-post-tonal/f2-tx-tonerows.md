# Class discussion

**What is serialism?**
- Using set rules/creating your own rules to follow in order to systematically compose a piece of music

**Using the transposition/inversion system we've used so far, it becomes clear that there are 24 total vesion of any default pitch class set. How do we represent this information in a streamlined, easily interpreted format?**
- Put it in a matrix! See examples in the textbook.
- Matrices can have any number of pitches in their pitch class sets, but we will deal most with 12-tone music, where a matrix is made up of a tone row with all 12 pitches

**12-tone music**
- Prime (P): a tone row or any of its transpositions
- Retrograde (R): any prime row played in reverse order
- Inversion (I): the inversion of the original prime tone row and all its inversions
- Retrograde Inversion (RI): any inverted row played in reverse order
  - When you make a matrix, these four groups will be easily labeled and organized! It ends up looking like a big square.

**Developing a matrix**
- When we construct a matrix, we write the original row across the top (horizontally) and its inversion down the side (vertically). This only works when your row begins with 0 (since 0's inversion is 0), so if you start your row with a first number other than 0, zero it out and use that one for your top row instead
- Once you have these two, you can transpose for each horizontal line going off of the first digits provided in the inversion/first veritcal column. The lines represent transpositions, and the columns are inversions
- You can check yourself by making sure that you have 0's in a diagonal across the middle from the upper left corner to the bottom right corner
- The subscript numbers will always match for P/R and I/RI. Retrograde and retrograde inversion labels *must* match the prime and inversion labels so that we know what they are a retrograde *of*. So, R and RI rows will have subscripts that don't match the number they start with.

The primary purpose for a tone row matrix is to use it as a point of reference to analyze 12-tone music. It gives us a list of all the possible rows a composer might use in their piece.

You can have a tone row with less than 12 tones, but our matrix method only works with a full 12-tone row. So don't use it for hexachords and stuff
