Welcome to the Integrated Musicianship Discord for your music theory and aural skills courses! We will use our Discord server to distribute assignments, answer homework questions, schedule tutoring, and a number of other class-related activities.

## Access

To access the server for the first time, you will need to click on the invite link in our university Blackboard Learn site and then create an account with Discord if you do not already have one. We do this because we do not want our server to be a public forum, so please do not share this link with anyone. All registered students have access to the BbLearn site via bblearn.uidaho.edu. If you know someone who would like to be a member of our Discord server, please refer them to one of the instructors to ask permission.

After you have registered for the first time from the invite link in BbLearn, you will have permanent access to our Discord. You can access Discord:
- through any web browser at www.discord.com
- through the Discord app on any Android or iOS device
- through the Discord widget in the class textbook (click on the chat icon in the upper left corner)
- through the invite link on BbLearn

## Rules

You may use this Discord server to discuss your coursework in a welcoming, safe space. Remember that even if you are not struggling, others might be, so we will have a zero-tolerance policy for behavior that could be considered bullying or overly negative. As such, please respect each other and the following rules:

- No inappropriate content or language. PG at all times!
- Use a civil tone for all posts. (Don't be a jerk.)
- No spamming. We love humor, but don't use so much that it is difficult to find information.
- No anonymous posting. If we cannot tell who you are, you will be muted until you have chosen a nickname that clearly states who you are. You can choose your display nickname for our server by clicking on the down arrow in the upper left corner of the Discord server screen.
- No self promotion without a moderator's approval. We are proud that you have gigs, but this is not the place to pester people...unless it has a specific relevance to our topics.
