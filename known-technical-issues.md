### Browser compatibility

To ensure all musical examples are rendered correctly, we recommend [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) or [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) when using this website.
- Chrome browser supports all abcjs functionality.
- Firefox browser does not support MIDI download.
- Safari browser does not support MIDI playback or download. This also means that iPhones will not be able to use the MIDI playback, because they force all browsers, including Chrome and Firefox for iOS, to use Safari's engine. 

### Current Known Technical Issues

Actions that may lock the module and require a refresh:

- Creating a blank line
- Multiple rapid changes without allowing time for rendering

Fix: 

- If you do not want to keep your changes, simply hit the 'Reset' button to reload the editor. 
- If you would like to save any changes that you have made:
    - Place your cursor in the editor's text box
    - Select all the text (Ctrl-A on PC, Command-A on Macs)
    - Copy the text (Ctrl-C on PC, Command-C on Macs)
    - Press the 'Reset' button below the editor box
    - Select all of the text again (Ctrl-A on PC, Command-A on Macs)
    - Paste your old text on top of the new text (Ctrl-V on PC, Command-A on Macs)
