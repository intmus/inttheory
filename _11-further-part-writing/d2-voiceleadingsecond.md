## Inversion Invasion

**If you see a 6/4 chord, it is most likely functioning as something other than the tonic.**

**The four types of tertiary functions:**
- Cadential
- Passing
- Pedal
- Arpeggiated

*Important!: second inversion chords are not the only type of chord that can have tertiary function. Also, second inversion chords do not always have tertiary function - it's just what happends most often.*


**Cadential 6/4 chords:**
- I6/4 will ALWAYS come before V(7). V(7) must be in root position because the bass movement must be static between the two chords. I6/4 - V(7) - I gives us a very smooth soprano line, but in order to do that there needs to be a common tone in the bass at some point
- I6/4 has dominant function because it extends V(7)
- Label it using a bracket to show dominant function:
  
    I6/4    V       I
  |____________|
         V
   D -----------    T      

**Passing 6/4 chords:**
- I - V - ii6/4 - V6 - I
  - Whenever you have a passing chord, its "primary function" becomes that of the chords around it, no matter was Roman numeral it is. In this example, ii6/4 has a dominant function because it acts as part of the V's around it
  - Their tertiary function is basically just to act as a bridge between other chords--to make voice leading easier. We wouldn't have been able to set up our cool contrasting motion soprano and bass in this example without the passing 6/4 in the middle
  - Passing chords are quite flexible. They can found in nearly any location in a chord progression. One voice (usually the bass) will have passing motion, and another voice having interchange (contrary motion).
  
  I - V - (ii6/4) - V6 - I
           (pass)
  T   D---------------   T
  
**Pedal 6/4 chords:**
- Centered around the idea of the pedal tone, whereas a passing chord is defined by (majority) passing motion
- How to differentiate a pedal chord from a pedal non-chord tone: if the bass is a chord member, it's a pedal chord! If it isn't, it's an NCT
- Static motion in perfect octaves is a PP8...unless it's a pedal
- Just like cadential and passing chords, these chords extend the harmonies on either side of them
- The pedal does NOT have to be in the bass, but it is almost always in the bass

  I    (IV6/4)    I
        (ped)
  T------------------       
  
 **Arpeggiated 6/4 chords:**
 - Not very common, needs a large amount of time to establish the pattern in order to identify. An example is large amounts of vamps (4 measures +) on one chord. The harmonic motion we hear is the whole chord motion changing every 4 or so bars. (i.e. I chord going to a I6 chord to a I6/4 chord over the course of 12+ measures).
