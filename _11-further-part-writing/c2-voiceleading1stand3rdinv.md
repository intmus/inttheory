title: Discussion 11c - Voice-leading for First and Third Inversion Chords

## Inversion Immersion

**Functional Substitution:**
- Two chords whose roots are separated by a third.
- They share the same function.

**Important tricks with the ii and IV chord:**
- Often, ii can be treated like a IV chord.
- You can double the third of a ii chord (which would be the root of the IV chord), but only if you resolve each third in a different way. One goes up by step to the root of the V chord, while one goes down to the fifith of the V chord. The motion of the latter third is like that of a frustrated leading tone.
- The notes in the IV chord could also be treated like the notes of the ii chord if you so desire.


**Voicing a viiº using functional substitution:**
- Can't double the root of a viiº because it's a tendency tone.
- The fifth is acting as the chordal seventh and follows the same resolution rules. Ex: in C, viiº is B diminished. The fifth of the chord, F, will resolve down by step to E in I
- Frustrated sevenths are not a thing. We can only have a frustrated leading tone.
- Don't try and do viiº in root position. As demonstrated in class, it doesn't really work--we tried multiple inner voicings and all of them had a bunch of errors
- I - viiº - V6/5 - I
  - This is the one time you can double the fifth in a root position viio because it will result in a doubled root for V6/5, but honestly...it's better to try and avoid them whenever possible


**Three levels of function:**
- Primary: predominant, dominant, and tonic. When we assign these to chords in a progression, we're saying they fill a certain slot.
- Secondary: chords that have a primary function in a secondary key center.
- Tertiary: they don't have a function in of themsleves, rather, they extend the function of a chord that they are next to.

**Passing chords:s**
- Creates passing motion. If you identify a chord as "passing," you're saying it has no primary function. Instead, we're using it for smooth voice leading. To ID these chords, you put the Roman numeral in parentheses and write "passing" underneath it
- Like other tertiary functions, these extend the primary functions on either side of them. If you insert a passing chord between two dominant function chords, you've simply lengthened the dominant section
- V6 - IV6 - V. We made the IV6 a vi and V6 to vi is good, but vi to V is not.... so we label it a passing chord.
  - There's no good option for this one, really...each one has its own errors, whether actual or just "not ideal," so it's a matter of picking the one that is the least bad
