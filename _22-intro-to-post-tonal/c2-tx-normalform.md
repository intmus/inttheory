## Normalcy

**Normal Form:**
- An ascending arrangement of a PC set in which the outside interval is smallest.
- We use this to compare with other PC sets.
- It is like when we put a chord in root position in order to compare it to other chords.
- Notated with *square brackets* and *commas*
- Ex: [2,6,7]

**"What happens when multiple of my PC sets are tied for the smallest outer interval?"**
- Find the set with the smaller interval that is second from the outside. Repeat this process if there are further tie breakers
