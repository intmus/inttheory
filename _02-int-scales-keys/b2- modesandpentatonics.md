## Modal Mayhem

**"Order the modes from lightest to darkest"**
- Lydian, ^#4
- Ionian, no changes from the major scale
- Mixolydian, ^b7
- Dorian, ^b3 ^b7
- Aeolian, ^b3, ^b6, ^b7
- Phrygian, ^b2, ^b3, ^b6, and ^b7
- Locrian, ^b2, ^b3, ^b5, ^b6, and ^b7

**"Why do the modes sound darker as we add more flats (or take away sharps)?"**
- We associate upward resolution with brightness.
- Partially from societal bias, partially from inherant consonance and dissonance built in our brains for survival purposes.

**"Why is Locrian so unused?"**
- Locrian is the only mode which doesn't contain a perfect fifth from ^1 to ^5, making the tonic chord extremely dissonant and feel unresolved.
- Also, the lowered ^5 prevents the mode from having a standard V to I resolution that we are accustomed to hearing.

**"How do most people think about modes?"**
- A major scale starting on different pitches. Using the same pitch collection with a different tonic.

**"How do you label intervals?"**
- It's important to remember that a dyad (two pitches played together) is different than an interval (the space between two pitches).
- Intervals are labeled with a quality first (perfect, major, minor, diminished, and augmented), and a quantity next (unison, second, third, fourth, etc.).
- Harmonic intervals are intervals played together, melodic intervals are played seperately (one after another).
- Simple intervals are intervals within the octave, compound intervals are inervals are that stretch further than an octave.

**"What on Earth is Lydian Dominant?"**
- Compared to Ionian (major), it has a raised ^4 and a lowered ^7
- You take the lower half of Lydian mode combined with the upper half of Mixolydian mode
- Solfege: Do, Re, Mi, Fi, So, La, Te

**How to practice/learn modes:**
- Think relative: What scale degree of Ionian do I start on to get this mode?
- Think parallel: What tones are altered compared to Ionian?

## Pentatonic Persnicketiness

**"What are some tricks to crafting pentatonic scales?"**
- Using a major scale, take out the tri-tone notes (degree ^4 and ^7) to form major pentatonic.
- Using a natural minor scale, take out scale degree ^2 and ^6 to form minor pentatonic
- In other words, for both major and minor pentatonic, you are removing the scale degrees which are a half-step away from a chord tone to form the pentatonic version
- Major and Minor pentatonic are modes of each other. The notes in a major pentatonic scale match the note in its relative minor pentatonic scale. (Ex: if you play the notes of C major pentatonic, but start on A, you will get A minor pentatonic)

**Pentatonic Solfege:**
- Major: Do, Re, Mi, So, La or ^1, ^2, ^3, ^5, ^6
- Minor: Do, Me, Fa, Sol, Te or ^1, ^b3, ^4, ^5, ^b7

### The Chromatic Scale ###

The chromatic scale consists entirely of half steps, and uses every pitch on the keyboard within a single octave. Here is the chromatic scale that spans the pitches C4 through C5.
