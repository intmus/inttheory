## Class Discussion 2022

"What is music?"

The best broad definition for music that doesn't exclude other world music is "Organized sound".

"How would you teach a beginner music student what an interval is?"

- It's hard to teach intervals without an understanding scales, and its hard to teach scales without and understanding of intervals.

- We start with relating to sounds first.

"How can we define whole steps and half steps without scales?"

- Looking at the keyboard, a half step is the closest possible next note.

Defining a scale

- There is a difference between a pitch collection and a scale. A pitch collection is just a collection of pitches. In order to make a pitch collection into a scale, it must be arranged in order decending or ascending.

- A scale must have one of each of the seven note names.

When writing out numbered scale degrees, (^1 ^2 ^3 ^4 ^5 ^6 ^7) the arrow goes above the number.

"Why do we use melodic minor?"

- It allows for tension and release in both directions. It includes the leading tone without having an augmented second like harmonic minor.

"What is the difference between parallel and relative minor?"

- Parallel scales have the same tonic, relative scales have the same notes or, pitch collection.

- Only the natural minor scale has a true relative major scale.

"Why do we call harmonic minor the harmonic minor scale"

- Because of the dominant-tonic relationship uses the dominant five chord, which requires the leading tone.

"Why does melodic minor sound more correct than harmonic minor?"

- Because Ti wants to resolve up to the tonic. When Ti is followed by Le, like in the harmonic minor version of Happy Birthday, there is a melodic augmented second.

### Definition of a Scale

- A scale is an arrangememnt of pitches using intervals of a second in ascending form. 

- A collection is a group of notes in any order you want. 

### Diatonic Classifications

^1 ^2 ^3 ^4 ^5 ^6 ^7 

Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti 

Tonic, Super Tonic, Mediant, Sub Dominant, Dominant, Sub Mediant, Leading Tone

The flatted leading tone is called the sub tonic, since in minor music, both the sub tonic and the leading tone are used. We will not use that type labelling much in this class. Some people use it, so we need to know it to an extent. 

### The Differences Between the Minor Scales

In natural and harmonic minor, a melody, such as happy birthday, has a few spots where it just sounds bad. Clunky notes or weird intervals make our ears wince a little bit. But, with melodic minor, which has both the sub tonic and leading tone, makes happy birthday normal, though having a minor sound. 

### Parallel Vs. Relative

Parallel scales start on the same pitch. Like D major and D minor. 

Relative scales share the same sharps and flats. Like C major and A natural minor.

## From *Open Music Theory*

A scale is a succession of pitches ascending or descending in steps. There are two types of steps: *half steps* and *whole steps*. A half step (H) consists of two adjacent pitches on the keyboard. A whole step (W) consists of two half steps. Usually, the pitches in a scale are each notated with different letter names, though this isn't always possible or desirable. 

### The major scale ###

A major scale, a sound with which you are undoubtedly familiar, consists of seven whole (W) and half (H) steps in the following succession: W-W-H-W-W-W-H. The first pitch of the scale, called the *tonic*, is the pitch upon which the rest of the scale is based. When the scale ascends, the tonic is repeated at the end an octave higher.

Here is the D major scale. It is called the "D major scale" because the pitch D is the *tonic* and is heard at both ends of the scale.

### Scale degrees and solfège ###

While ISO notation allows us to label a pitch in its specific register, it is often useful to know where that pitch fits within a given scale. For example, the pitch class D is the first (and last) note of the D-major scale. The pitch class A is the fifth note of the D-major scale. When described in this way, we call the notes *scale degrees*, because they're placed in context of a specific scale. Solfège syllables, [a centuries-old method of teaching pitch and sight singing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solfège), can also be used to represent scale degrees (when used in this way, this system is specifically called movable-*do* solfège). 

Scale degrees are labeled with Arabic numerals and carets (^). The illustration below shows a D-major scale and corresponding ISO notation, scale degrees, and solfège syllables.

### The minor scale ###

Another scale with which you are likely very familiar is the minor scale. There are several scales that one might describe as *minor*, all of which have a characteristic third scale degree that is lower than the one found in the major scale. The minor scale most frequently used in tonal music from the Common Practice period is based on the *aeolian mode* (you'll read more about modes later), which is sometimes referred to as the *natural minor* scale. 

The natural minor scale consists of seven whole (W) and half (H) steps in the following succession: W-H-W-W-H-W-W. Note the changes in solfège syllables.

If you sing through the above example, you'll notice that the ending lacks the same sense of closure you heard in the major scale. This closure is created in the major scale, in part, by the ascending semitone between *ti* and *do*. Composers often want to have this sense of closure when using the minor mode, too. They're able to achieve this by applying an accidental to the seventh scale degree, raising it by a semitone. If you do this within the context of the natural minor scale, you get something called the *harmonic minor* scale.

Now the last two notes of the scale sound much more conclusive, but you might have found it difficult to sing *le* to *ti*. When writing melodies in a minor key, composers often "corrected" this by raising *le* by a semitone to become *la* when approaching the note *ti*. When the melody descended from *do*, the closure from *ti* to *do* isn't needed; likewise, it is no longer necessary to "correct" *le*, so the natural form of the minor scale is used again. Together, these different ascending and descending versions are called the *melodic minor* scale.

When ascending, the *melodic minor* scale uses *la* and *ti*.

When descending, the *melodic minor* scale uses the "natural" *te* and *le*.

Truth be told, most composers don't really think about three different "forms" of the minor scale. The *harmonic minor* scale simply represents composers' tendency to use *ti* when building harmonies that include the seventh scale degree in the minor mode. Likewise, the *melodic minor* scale is derived from composers' desire to avoid the melodic augmented second interval (more on this in the [intervals](intervals.html) section) between *le* and *ti* (and some chose not to avoid this!). In reality, there is only one "version" of the minor scale. Context determines when a composer might use *la* and *ti* when writing music in a minor key.
