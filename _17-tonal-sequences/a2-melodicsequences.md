## Sequential Essentials

- Sequences are repeated melodic or harmonic material that is transposed up or down by a constant interval. The interval that the sequence is moved is called the interval of transposition.

### Classifying Sequences
**Diatonic Sequences**
- Every note is in the key signature.
- The intervals between notes are *not* always the exact same size compared to other iterations of the pattern, becuase the intervals are relative to the key.
- The interval of transposition is also relative to the key it is in, and not exact.
- The interval of transposition is labeled only quantitatively, without a quality.

**Chromatic Sequences**
- Not every note is in the key signature.
- The intervals between notes are *always* the exact same size compared to other iterations of the pattern.
- The interval of transposition is exactly the same every time.
- The interval of transposition is labeled with both a quantity and a quality.

**Mixed Sequences**
- This is when one aspect of a sequence is diatonic, and another is chromatic. For example:
- The intervals within the iteration are exact and chromatic, but it transposes by diatonic intervals.

***Ascending* and *Descending* refer to the direction of the transposition**

### Labeling Sequences
1. Put a horizontal bracket over the top of the notes in the sequential unit.
2. Between the bracket of the current unit and the next unit, draw an arrow pointed up or down to show ascending or descending transposition.
3. Label the quantity of the interval of transposition. Also label the *quality* of the interval, but *only if it is a chromatic sequence*.
4. Label the chord function of the passage as tertiary, with a little (seq) in parentheses.

**"How do we determine the iteration length when there are multiple possibilities?"**
- Use the smallest length of iteration that works.
