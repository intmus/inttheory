## Sequence Secrets

**Harmonic Sequences**

- A harmonic sequence is when the roots of the chords in a progression are moving like a sequence. 
- (*remember that the bass notes might not always be the roots!*)

**A two voice sequence**
- Is this example functional? Can you harmonize the example (come up with a progression for it)? Can we have a cadence as we normally would?
- Sequences don't have to follow functional progression rules if the motion of the melody follows a strong pattern.


**Common sequences**
- Parallel 6 chords
  - Made entirely of first inversion chords. Goal is a smooth + strong bassline
  - Always descending
- Pachelbel's sequence
  - Suuuuuuuper prevalent, you hear it everywhere
  - This is the reason we have iii -> IV in our chord progression chart! This progression works in Pachelbel's Canon in D and is used widely even today
