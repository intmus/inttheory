## Sequence Secrets

**Harmonic Sequences:**

- A harmonic sequence is when the **roots** of the chords in a progression are moving like a sequence. 
- (*remember that the bass notes might not always be the roots!*)

**"Why do they work?"**
- Humans like patterns!
- Sequences don't have to follow functional progression rules if the motion of the melody follows a strong pattern.

### Classification and Labeling:

**This process works the same as for melodic sequences**
- Look if the roots move by exact intervals, or if they move diatonically. **Leadsheet is the secret to spotting sequential root movement!!**
- Rather than putting brackets over the notes, you put brackets under the roman numerals.
- You label the interval of transposition the same as with melodic sequences - with an arrow and an interval.

### Common sequences:
**Parallel 6:**
  - Made entirely of first inversion chords. Because of this, there's always a sixth somewhere between the bass and one of the voices.
  - The bass is descending in stepwise motion

**Pachelbel's Sequence:**
  - This sequence transposes down a third every iteration. Each iteration is made up of two chords.
  - You can spell the chords in different inversions so that the bass line descends in stepwise motion.
  - This is the reason we have iii -> IV in our chord progression chart! This progression works in Pachelbel's "Canon in D" and is used widely even today.
