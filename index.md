The textbook is designed to maximize flexibility and support an inquiry-based model of instruction. 
For a simple explanation of this model as well as how to best utilize this textbook's structure, please view [About this textbook]({{ site.baseurl }}/about.html).

If you are already familiar with the inquiry-based model, you can begin exploring the textbook using the side bar navigation or by browsing the [Table of contents]({{ site.baseurl }}/toc.html).

Integrated Musicianship makes use of [abcjs](https://github.com/paulrosen/abcjs) to present interactive musical examples throughout the text. 
Checkout the [ABC Tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}/abc-tutorial.html) to get started with ABC Notation. *Note: the full functionality of abcjs works best on up-to-date Chrome or Firefox browsers.*
