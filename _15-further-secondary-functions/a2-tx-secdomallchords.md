Other secondary chords

The ii and the V/V chords aren’t the only ones that are interchangeable. In fact, almost every chord on our “chord flowchart” can be replaced by a secondary dominant chord that resolves to the next chord. For example, a V/ii chord can be placed before a ii chord by replacing the vi chord. A V/vi chord can be placed before a vi chord by replacing the iii chord. These can all also be seventh chords

When tonicizing a major chord, you can use a vii%7 of the next chord, or a viio7 of the next chord.

Harmonization of "Inserting secondary dominant functions into various root movement patterns"

Progression I, vi7, V7/ii, ii, V7/V, V7, I

Soprano: C, C, C#, D, D, D, C Alto: E, G, G, F, F#, G, E Tenor: G, A, A, C, C, B, G

Bass notes (found from inversion): C, A, A, D, D, G, C

Any major, minor, or dominant quality can be tonicized. For leading tone chords, check previous page chpt.15a.

Inserting secondary dominants helps to create smooth bass lines.

## More Secondary Dominant Functions
Any chord can have secondary function, not just dominants and leading-tones.

The V/IV in C is a C major chord. 
The only reason to label a C chord as V/IV is if the V is a V7. 
This makes a V7/IV, spelled CEGBb, or I7. 
BUT you will NEVER see a I7. 
It's function is the dominant of F, or the IV, so we write it as V7/IV. 
This is the same idea as the V/V being a II, but you will never write it as a II because that's not how it functions. 

### Secondary Dominant chords for functions other than Dominant
This can include:
- V/vi
- V/ii
- V/I (don't write)
- etc.

The chord guide chart has secondary function replacements for each chord.

Diatonic Harmony:
iii - vi - ii - V - I

Chromatic Harmony:
V/vi - V/ii - V/V - V/I - V/IV
- these can all be 7th chords as well
- in that case, the V/IV only functions as a 7th chord
- the V/V is included as a pre-dominant function

When can we use a secondary dominant funtion?
- to prepare for a modulation
- when there's a circle of fifth progression
- *where there are chords*
  - the only chord you can't decorate is a diminished chord
  - every other chord can be tonicized
  
The root movement is the same whether you use diatonic or chromatic harmony. 

#### Example In Ab
Where can you insert a secondary dominant?

iii - vi - ii - V - I

Cm - Fm - Bbm - Eb - Ab
  - On the Fm chord
iii - V/ii - ii - V - I

Cm - F - Bbm - Eb - Ab
- chromatic harmonies like to move in half-step motion. 
  - flats resolve down
  - sharps resolve up
  
  With the V/ii - ii (F - Bbm), the chordal third of the V/ii resloves to the the root of the ii.
  If the secondary dominant is a seventh chord (V7/ii), the chordal seventh resolves to the third of the ii chord. 
  - this is because half-step motion likes to resolve
  
Take the progression V7/V - V7 - I in C (D7 - G7 - C).
The chordal third of the D7 (F#) resolves up to the root of the V7 (G). 
- this is F# moving upward in half-step motion

The chordal seventh of the D7 (C) resolves down to the third of the V7 (B).
- more half-step motion

#### Example In C: Inserting Secondary Dominant Functions
Given... 

Soprano: C5 - C5 - C5 - C5 - D5 - D5 - D5 - C5 

Alto: E4 - 

Tenor: G3 - 

Bass: C3 - C3 - A2 - A2 - F2 - F2 - G2 - C3

Roman Numerals: I - x - vi - x - IV - x - V7 - I
- any place there is an *x* in the progression there can be a secondary dominant

Fill it in...

Lead Sheet: C - E7/B - Am - C7/G - F - D7/F# - G - C

Soprano: C5 - D5 - C5 - C5 - D5 - D5 - D5 - C5 

Alto: E4 - E4 - E4 - E4 - F4 - D4 - F4 - E4

Tenor: G3 - G#3 - A3 - Bb3 - A3 - A3 - B3 - G3

Bass: C3 - B2 - A2 - G2 - F2 - F#2 - G2 - C3

Roman Numerals: I - V^4/3/vi - vi - V^4/3/IV - IV - V^6/V - V7 - I
- notice that any accicentals only move in the half-step motion of their tendancy
  - sharp accidentals resolve up
  - flat accidentals resolve down
