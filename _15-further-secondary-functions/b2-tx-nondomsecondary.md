Non-Dominant Function Secondary Chords

Not all secondary chords are dominant. Secondary dominant chords function to tonicize (go to the key of) the next chord. We can extend that further to include chords that would appear before a V chord in that new key. For example, we can have progressions like ii, V, I in another key. If we are going to IV, this would look like ii/IV, V/IV, IV.

These chords are rare! Most of the time, the chord that appears before a secondary dominant chord will be diatonic, and therefore not a non-dominant secondary chord.

Deceptive motion can also exist in other keys (for example, V7/vi can go to IV).

## Non-dominant Function Secondary Chords

**Other secondary functions**
- What is up with this weird mystery chord??? (Gmin in C major)
  - Is it a iv/ii? It's followed by a V/ii, so is it just an extended progression?: Yep! It looks kind of weird, but that's exactly what it is.
- *Contextual analysis tips:* always be thinking about what you're analyzing actually *sounds.* All Roman numerals do is label function. They're like a legend indicating what we hear
  - Think of chords in a secondary progression as being tied together by a string. In our progression iv/ii - V42/ii - ii6 - V7 - I, the first three chords are basically a bundle setting up our V7.

**Ambiguous secondary functions**
- You can also label the Am chord as ii/V. You shouldn't do that, because it's overthinking, but you could. Remember: *always be thinking about what you're analyzing actually sounds like.* How does the Am chord function? Label it properly in order to reflect what you hear.
