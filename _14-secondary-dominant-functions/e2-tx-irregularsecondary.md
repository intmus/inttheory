## Introduction to the Irregular

**"Each chord can be thought of differently going into it and then going out of it."**

### Corner Case Recap:

**Consecutive secondary dominants:**
- When you move from one dominant chord to another, thirds resolve down a half step to sevenths, rather than resolving up to the root.
- For example, if you go from E7 to A7, the G# in the E7 resolves to the G in the A7.
- Sevenths resolve like normal - down by step to the third of the following chord.

**Secondary dominants and their related chords**
- V/V and ii
- V/ii and vi
- V/vi and iii
- For all of these, you identify them by listening to/noting the quality of the chord. Secondary dominants are always going to be major, while all their counterparts listed above (aka normalsauce variants) will be minor

**Deceptive resolutions in a secondary key:**
- V7/vi should resolve to vi, but we have it going to IV instead which is weird
  - It's a deceptive progression!! V7/vi - IV is V - VI in C's relative minor, A minor
- To ID this correctly, be looking for a secondary dominant chord that...
  - Doesn't go where it's supposed to
  - Is followed by a root position chord WITH root movement up by step
