## Introduction to the Irregular

**"Each chord can be thought of differently going into it and then going out of it."**

### Corner Case Recap:

**Consecutive secondary dominants:**
- When you move from one dominant chord to another, thirds resolve down a half step to sevenths, rather than resolving up to the root.
- For example, if you go from E7 to A7, the G# in the E7 resolves to the G in the A7.
- Sevenths resolve like normal - down by step to the third of the following chord.

**Deceptive resolutions in a secondary key:**
- This is when the V in a secondary key resolves to the vi in that same secondary key. For example: V/V to vi/V
- BE WATCHFUL though, because the Roman Numerals you initially write might not reveal this! You could have written V/V to iii, which are the same chords, and then you'll be confused what on earth it is.
- Another commonly occuring one is V/vi to iv, which is secretly V/vi to vi/vi.
