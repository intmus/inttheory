## Broadening Horizons

**"Can you tonicize any chord?"**
- No. Diminished chords cannot be tonicized (except for the iiº chord in a minor key, but it's weird)

**"When can I use a viiø7 versus a viiº7?"**
- You can use viiº7 to tonicize major or minor chords, but viiø7 works *only* with major chords. This is becuase viiø7 is a diatonic chord only in major keys, and the voice-leading is weak when trying to resolve it to a minor chord.
- viiº7 can be used to tonicize either minor or major keys, becuase the voice-leading works well.
