## Class discussion

**"Are secondary leading-tone chords also secondary dominant chords?"**
- Well, it depends. If you are using a secondary leading-tone chord like a secondary dominant chord, it's fine to call it a secondary dominant, because its only difference is that it's missing one note. They both have dominant function in the secondary key.
- However, if you are using a secondary leading-tone chord as a substitution for a IV chord, then it is just a predominant chord (not secondary function).

**"How do you voice a secondary leading-tone chord?"**
- Voice it with the same tricks that you usually use for viiº or viiº7 chords.
- So, **don't** double the root, and instead double the third.

**Creating a V7/V**
- Once we figured out our voicing, we changed the V7/V to a viiº/V. This is possible because viiº is just V7 without the root.
- We had a lot of problems trying to figure out which tone to double in viiº/V. There's two tendency tones, and with the voicing we wrote out doubling the third results in parallel octaves. Bad all around, just don't use these...use seventh chords instead

**Using a secondary leading-tone seventh chord**
- You can use viiº7 to tonicize major or minor chords, but viiø7 works *only* with major chords. If you try and tonicize a minor chord with viiø7, things will get really screwed up because of where all the voices want to resolve
- When trying to correctly resolve a viiº7/V, it might be easier to think of the regular vii07 solfege: ti re fa le. This will help you resolve the tendency tones correctly into the next chord. Remember: all you're doing is thinking of viiº7 in the key of V.
