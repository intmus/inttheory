## Leading-tone Liaison

**"Are secondary leading-tone chords also secondary dominant chords?"**
- Well, it depends. If you are using a secondary leading-tone chord like a secondary dominant chord, it's fine to call it a secondary dominant, because its only difference is that it's missing one note. They both have dominant function in the secondary key.
- However, if you are using a secondary leading-tone chord as a substitution for a IV chord, then it is just a predominant chord (not secondary function).

**"How do you voice a secondary leading-tone chord?"**
- Voice it with the same tricks that you usually use for viiº or viiº7 chords.
- So, **don't** double the root, and instead double the third.

**viiº7/V versus viiø7/V**
- Since the V chord is major, you can use either a viiø7 or a viiº7 just fine.
