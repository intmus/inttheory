### Periods

A period is one type of theme, like the [sentence](sentence.html), common to the Classical style.

The period is generally eight measures long and contains two four-measure phrases, called  *antecedent* and *consequent*.

The period is characterized by balance and symmetry. Its antecedent phrase is initiated by a basic idea that recurs at the beginning of the consequent phrase. Unlike the sentence, which exhibits a single cadence, the period contains *two cadences*, a weak one to end the *antecedent* and a strong one to end the *consequent*.

#### Antecedent phrase (mm. 1–4)

Unlike the sentence, which contains a basic idea followed by a repetition, the two measure basic idea that begins the a period's antecedent is always followed by a two-measure *contrasting idea* (CI). That contrasting idea supports a cadential progression that ends the antecedent with a weak cadence, either a HC or an IAC.

Note the contrast created between the basic idea and contrasting idea. While the BI ascends, outlining the tonic triad with leaps to each of its members, the CI descends stepwise leading to a weak I:HC. The emphasis on tonic in the melody of the BI is accompanied by a tonic prolongation in the harmony (a variant of the [*Romanesca* schema](schemataOpensAndCloses.html)):

> **I V6 VI III**  
or  
**T(1 D7p x6 3)**

Supporting the CI is an expanded cadential progression:

> **III IV V<sup>6/5</sup>/V V**  
or  
**T3 S(4 [+]) D5**

<!--The formal functional progression in this example is identical to the antecedent (which is often the case): the BI exhibits presentation function, and the CI exhibits continuation–cadential function. Note that Haydn uses a single subdominant chord in the consequent (the applied chord from the antecedent has been dropped) and moves to the dominant one beat earlier so that the PAC’s tonic arrival can come on the downbeat of the last bar of the phrase. This compression of the cadential progression to accommodate the additional tonic chord at the end is common.-->

#### Consequent phrase (mm. 5–8)

Consequent phrases always begin with a restatement of the BI, occasionally varied, and end with a CI. A consequent phrase's CI often resembles the antecedent's, but slightly altered to accommodate a stronger cadence. It is also common for a consequent phrase's CI to be entirely new. While a sentence can close with a number of cadence types, the period's consequent phrase always ends with a PAC:

In this example, the BI is restated exactly at the beginning of the consequent. The concluding CI is a slight variation of the end of the antecedent, altered here to create a PAC.
