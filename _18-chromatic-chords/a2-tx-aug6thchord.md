## AAAAAAAUUUUUGGGGHHHmented Sixth Chords

**"What are they?"**
- They are a collection tendency tones
- Their main purpose is to lead into a V chord
- They always contain an augmented sixth interval

**"How are they made?"**
- They all contain Do of their home key
- They all contain Le and Fi
- When spelled out, Le goes on the bottomm and Fi goes on the top. This is how you get an augmented sixth interval within the chord.

### Italian:
- **It<sup>+6</sup>**
- Solfege: Le, Do, Fi
- Scale degrees: b6, 1, #4
- Italian is the "base model" version, which includes only the three necessary chord tones to make an augmented sixth chord.
- **Le** always resolves down to **So**, and **Fi** always resolves up to **So**. **Do** is the only chord tone that gets doubled, becuase it can resolve in different ways.

### French:
- **Fr<sup>+6</sup>**
- Solfege: Le, Do, Re, Fi
- Scale degrees: b6, 1, 2, #4
- French adds "Re", which can carry through to the V chord, not needing to move.
- **Le** always resolves down to **So**, and **Fi** always resolves up to **So**. **Do** will reslve to **Ti** if going to a V chord, and **Re** will remain as **Re** if going to a V chord.
- If it is used to go to a cadential 6/4 in minor, **Re** will go to **Me**.

### German:
- **Ger<sup>+6</sup>**
- Solfege: Le, Do, Me, Fi
- Scale degrees: b6, 1, b3, #4
- German adds "Me"
- **Le** always resolves down to **So**, and **Fi** always resolves up to **So**. **Me** creates a voice leading issue because it resolves in parallel perfect fifths with **Le**. Because of this, German aug sixth chords often go to a I<sup>6/4</sup> and then to a V.

### Additional Notes:
- The leadsheet notation for these chords are the **same as the roman numerals**.
- An augmented sixth chord is almost always **predominant** function, because they almost always resolve to V, or I6/4.
- There are **no inversions** of these chords, becuase they are not triads.
- Watch out for enharmonic re-spellings! In a real score, the accidentals on an aug sixth chord will be based on how each voice resolves, and may not match the accidentals you are used to seeing.

**Steps for Building an Augmented sixth chord in any key:**
1. Write in "Do".
2. Figure out what is "So".
3. Underneath Do, write in the note that is a half-step above So.
4. Above Do, write in the note that is a half-step below So.
5. If it is French, add in "Re" above Do.
6. If it is German, add in "Me" above Do.

### Non-Standard Uses:
**Ger<sup>+6</sup> resolving to a I chord:**
- In this case, the Ger<sup>+6</sup> is acting with dominant function.
- It is labeled with a slash: Ger<sup>+6</sup>/ 1<sup>^</sup>
- The slash and scale degree indicates what scale degree of the home key the augmented sixth interval resolves to.
