## AAAAAAAUUUUUGGGGHHHmented Sixth Chords

**"What are they?"**
- They are a collection tendency tones
- Their main purpose is to lead into a V chord
- They always contain an augmented sixth interval

**"How are they made?"**
- They all contain Do of their home key
- They all contain Le and Fi
- When spelled out, Le goes on the bottomm and Fi goes on the top. This is how you get an augmented sixth interval within the chord.

### Italian:
- **It<sup>+6</sup>**
- Solfege: Le, Do, Fi
- Scale degrees: b6, 1, #4
- Italian is the "base model" version, which includes only the three necessary chord tones to make an augmented sixth chord.
- **Le** always resolves down to **So**, and **Fi** always resolves up to **So**. **Do** is the only chord tone that gets doubled, becuase it can resolve in different ways.

### French:
- **Fr<sup>+6</sup>**
- Solfege: Le, Do, Re, Fi
- Scale degrees: b6, 1, 2, #4
- French adds "Re", which can carry through to the V chord, not needing to move.
- **Le** always resolves down to **So**, and **Fi** always resolves up to **So**. **Do** will reslve to **Ti** if going to a V chord, and **Re** will remain as **Re** if going to a V chord.
- If it is used to go to a cadential 6/4 in minor, **Re** will go to **Me**.

### German:
- **Ger<sup>+6</sup>**
- Solfege: Le, Do, Me, Fi
- Scale degrees: b6, 1, b3, #4
- German adds "Me"
- **Le** always resolves down to **So**, and **Fi** always resolves up to **So**. **Me** creates a voice leading issue because it resolves in parallel perfect fifths with **Le**.

### Additional Notes:
- The leadsheet notation for these chords are the **same as the roman numerals**.
- The augmented sixth chord is almost always **predominant** function, because they almost always resolve to V, or I6/4.
- There are **no inversions** of these chords, becuase they are not triads.

**Steps for Building an Augmented sixth chord in any key:**
1. Write in "Do".
2. Figure out what is "So".
3. Underneath Do, write in the note that is a half-step above So.
4. Above Do, write in the note that is a half-step below So.

# Class discussion 2022

**Augmented sixth chords resolving to a non-dominant harmony**
- By writing some notes enharmonically, we can basically sub in one dominant chord for another. In the example we did in class (in C), the respelled Ger+6 translated to a Db7, which still moved nicely over to V7.
  - Process: writing out the full chord (Db F Ab B) and respelling the B as a Cb. Cb wants to resolve down to the B in the next chord, and the F carries through to be the seventh.
- If you keep the chord as written, we have our normal +6 chord function: the actual +6 resolves outward to the root of the next chord. So our original +6 chord from the example resolves to a C major chord.
  - Labeling: instead of using our "in the key of" secondary dominant labeling, the slash indicates "going to" and you write the scale degree below the slash. The Ger+6 in this example would be written as Ger+6/^1 (remember the caret should be written above the number)
  - In this instance, Ger+6/^1 actually has *dominant* function, rather than predominant. It subs in for V7 and proceeds straight to I. Think of respelling the chord as a Db7! Ger+6s can have dominant function...but only sometimes
