## Common-tone Commotion

### Like augmented sixth chords, these are a collection of tendency tones.

**Where it gets its name:**
- A common tone diminished 7th chord is a fully diminished seventh chord that shares one note with the chord before it and the chord after it. This shared note acts like a pedal tone.

**Uses:**
1. Going from a I chord to a ct<sup>o7</sup>, then back to I.
2. Going from V or V<sup>7</sup> to a ct<sup>o7</sup>, then back to V or V<sup>7</sup>.

**How they're made:**
- Write in the root of the chord that comes before and after it. This is the common tone that will remain the same throughout.
- Add in the other three notes that make it a fully diminished 7th chord.
- These other notes must be spelled in a way that the accidentals resolve properly to their appropriate notes.
- Ex: a ct<sup>o7</sup> chord that is between two A major chords will be spelled **A, B<sup>#</sup>, D<sup>#</sup>, F<sup>#</sup>**. The A resolves to A, the B<sup>#</sup> resolves to C<sup>#</sup>, the D<sup>#</sup> resolves to E, and the F<sup>#</sup> reolves up to A. (If it were resolving to an A<sup>7</sup> chord, the F<sup>#</sup> would resolve to G)
- So, **don't be fooled**! The common tone is never the actual root of the diminished chord.

**Shortcuts:**
- ct<sup>o7</sup> of I is a #ii<sup>o4/2</sup>
- ct<sup>o7</sup> of V is a #vi<sup>o4/2</sup>

**Labeling:**
- The leadsheet will be normal, identifying exactly what diminished chord it is.
- Instead of a roman numeral, it will be labeled as ct<sup>o7</sup> below the staff. There are no inversion of this!
