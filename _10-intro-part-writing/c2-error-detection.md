# Class discussion

**Parallel perfect octaves (PP8)**
- What causes this part-writing error?
  - Both tones in our example are the leading tone of I--we have doubled thirds!
- Why is this bad?
  - Lack of voice independency. A bunch of parallel motion can cause voices to bleed together, and then when they separate again it can be jarring to the overall texture
- If you were going to fix this, how would you do it?
  - Have soprano sing a D in the first note of the second measure? (techincally yes, but it makes a jumpier melody which isn't ideal)
  - In the same place, change the tenor to a D instead of the soprano?
  - Double the G in the lower two voices?
  - Have soprano sing a D on the second and third chords?
  - BASICALLY: fixing the errors is never as simple as you want it, and there's a bunch of different ways to do it. Fixing them can be...trial and error :)
  
**Parallel perfect fifths (PP5)**
- Still considered a PP5 even in distant voices?
  - Yes! Any of these movement errors can happen between any 2 voices

**Contrary perfect fifths and octaves (CP5, CP8)**
- Usually happens when trying to fix a parallel movement error by moving one voice an octave down. It isn't ideal to sing and usually creates spacing errors as a result
- Red flag: if there's a HUGE leap in one of the voices, there's probably a contrary P5 or P8

**Unacceptable unequal fifths (UU5)**
- movement from a d5 to a P5
- must involve the bass
- Red flag: tendency tones not resolving the way they're supposed to
  - Ex: in C, B and F resolving to C and G. F is the seventh of a G7 chord and is supposed to resolve downward by step to the third of the next chord, but it went up to G instead.
- There is no octaves version of this one, fifths only

**Unacceptable similar fifths and octaves (US5, US8)**
- The most restrictve of these movement errors, so if you look for the specifics it will be easy to find!
  - Can only happen in the soprano and bass
  - Red flag: Skip of a third or more in the soprano voice + similar motion in soprano and bass
  - Second interval must be a P5 or P8. What matters is what interval it lands on, not what it starts on
