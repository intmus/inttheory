## Part Smarts

**"What is the difference between voice-leading and part-writing?**
- Voice-leading is all about how a single voice moves through the harmony.
- Part-writing deals with how those voices move in relation to each other.

**"What does it mean that part-writing errors are *symptoms* of voice-leading errors?"**
- Voice-leading errors cause part-writing errors. So, if you find a part-writing error, it means that a voice-leading error is occuring somewhere in those voices.
- If you write your parts with good voice-leading in mind, you won't have to worry about creating errros!

**"Why is good part-writing important?"**
- Good part-writing is easier to play.
- Good part-wrting is more enjoyable to play. Especially for inner-voice players, melodic lines make the music more interesting for the player and the listener.

**WARNING: when you attempt to fix a part-writing error, more errors may be generated!**
