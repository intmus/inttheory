---

## Further Non-sense

**Figures:**
- Any line that matches the shape of a non-chord tone, but contains only chord tones
- "Oops, all chord tones!"

**Other ways to think about Neighbor Groups (Double Neighbor Tone):**
- An *enclosure*. This is a commonly used term in jazz improvisation.
- A decoration around a single pitch. Always returns to the note it began on.
- Two neighbor tones stapled together.

**Escape Tones:**
- The resolution by leap is as if the resolving note is escaping from the nasty non-chord tone.

**"In low brass we often talk about playing pedal notes, which are really low notes. Is that related to pedal notes in non-chord tones?"**
- In the instrument world, the term "pedal tone" references and organ's foot pedals, which are extremely low bass notes. So, we use the term "pedal tone" as slang to refer to any really low note on our instrument. **It has nothing to do with pedal tones in musical analysis**.
- That being said, they could occur simultaneously if you're playing a low pedal note and sustaining over multiple changing chords.
- In NCT analysis, a pedal can happen in any voice, in any register.
- When a pedal occurs in the bass voice, use the next note up to determine the inversion of the chord.
