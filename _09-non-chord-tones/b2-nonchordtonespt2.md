More Non-chord Tones

Double Neighbor Tones or Neighbor groups

- Surrounding a chord tone with both possible neighbor tones. Neighbor groups are when a chord tone steps to a neighbor tone, then skips a third in the opposite direction to the other neighbor tone, then resolves. It can also step through the original chord tone before moving to the other neighbor tone instead of skipping to it. Labeled NG or DNT.

Appoggiaturas 

- Approached by step and left by a skip in the opposite direction.

Escape Tones

- Approached by a skip and left by a step in the opposite direction.

Anticipation

- When a chord tone from the following chord is played early, or on the previous chord.

Pedal Points

- When a tone stays the same through one chord into another chord making it a non-chord tone, and then becomes a chord tone again.

Incomplete Neighbor Tones

- Approached by leap and left by step in the same direction.

## Class discussion 2021

**Double Neighbor Tones** 
Decorates a single pitch, has to come back to the original pitch.
- Enclosure! It doesnt matter if you to up or down first, but there is a stepwise note above and below.
- Two neighbor tones stapled together.

**Incomplete Neighbor Group/Tone**
- Use as a last resort. 
- Happens when you have a normal neighbor group or neighbor tone, but the approach and resolution are not the same note. 
- Only use when there isn't another option. 
- For incomplete neighbor tones, unlike either appogiaturas or escape tones,you don't have to resolve in the opposite direction. 
- If you have a lot of incomplete neighbor tones and groups, you're probably not in the right tonality. 
 
**Appoggiatura (APP)** 
Approached by leap and left by step in the opposite direction.

**Escape Tone (ET)**
Approached by step and left by leap in the opposite direction.

*appoggiaturas and escape tones are the most common NCT's*
*make sure to remember which is which*

**Anticipations (ANT)**
A reverse suspension, although not upsidedown like retardations. Putting your car in reverse doesn't put it on its roof.
- A chord tone that shows up too early.
- Its going to be a chord tone soon, but not yet because the chord hasn't changed yet.
- Resolved by static motion.
- Preparation can be a leap or a step, doesn't matter too much.

**Pedals (PED)**
Any non chord tone approached by static motion and left by static motion across at least three chords. When labeling with a pedal, use the next voice up to determine inversion.

**"Figure"**
It has the right shape, but aren't non-chord tones. This concept can apply to any NCT. Check if they're chord tones!
*ex: There's an appoggiatura figure in [insert random piece], measure 21.
