# Editing Lesson pages

The Lesson section of each topic is intended to contain notes generated by class discussion. 

Course TA will take notes in class, committing them the GitHub project.
Sean will edit the results.
This will function as the primary reference text as it will contain the rules of the concepts as explained by the class with Sean's annotations and terminology.

## Procedure

Editors must be added as Collaborators to the repository. 
Go to repository settings tab, click "Collaborators" on the left menu, and add editors using github user name or email.
Collaborators will need to accept the invitation sent to their email.

- Log into GitHub.
- Navigate the files to the chapter and lesson for the day, which is designated with `3-tx-` in the file name and is a markdown `.md` file.
- On the file's page, click the pencil icon to open the web editor.
- add class discussion notes under a `## Class Discussion` section.
- save the notes by scrolling down and using "Commit changes". Please add a description of the commit with ??, then click the green "Commit changes" button.
