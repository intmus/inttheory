## Class Discussion

"Why do chords have a certain pull?"

- A V7 chord pulls to a I chord for many reasons. A chord will often have a pull to the chord whos root is a perfect fifth away (vi to ii, ii to V, V to I). The third of a V chord is the leading tone, and wants to resolve to the tonic. The seventh of a V7 chord resolves down to the third of the tonic. All of these tones in the V7 chord pull to the tonic.

"What is Chord Function?"

- Primary functions - Tonic, Dominant, and Pre-dominant

- Tonic - A tonic functioning chord is "home base". Stable in the current key. The I chord is tonic.

- Dominant - A dominant functioning chord wants to move to the tonic. The V (V7) and viio (viio7) chords are dominant.

- Pre-dominant - A pre-dominant functioning chord sets up a dominant chord (pulls to the dominant). IV and ii chords are pre-dominant.

When the roots of the chords in a progression have move in descending fifths, it is called a "circle of fifths progression".

## Class discussion 2021

**Implied Harmony in Two Parts**
- You hear a V7 chord but only have the root. Why?
  - We are conditioned to hear that V chord (and you just listened to a ton of them before this).

- Dissonance wants to resolve to consonance.

- Why is the first measure "stronger" than the second?
  - The two do's in bass and soprano voices. 
  
- Factors that affect how "strong" something is 
  - People are generally better at hearing higher voices
  - Inverted chords
  - Intervals between voices
  
**Harmonic functions in diatonic music**
- The vi chord can be considered tonic because of shared tones with the I chord, but it has to be set   up with that intention. In this class, it will not function in that way.

**Cadence**
- "The end of our musical sentence when it feels like a musical ending; the harmonic progression at     the end of the phrase."

## From *Open Music Theory*

### Chord voicing

In strict keyboard-style writing, there are four voices: the bass line (which is usually a given in *basso continuo* style), and three *upper voices*: the *melody* or *soprano*, the *alto*, and the *tenor* (from highest to lowest). Since all three upper voices must be played by a single hand, they should never span more than an octave.

The melody always has an upward-pointing stem. Alto and tenor share a downward-pointing stem. If the alto and tenor share a note, that note receives a single downward-pointing stem. (See m. 1 of the example below.) If melody and alto share a note, that notehead is double-stemmed. (See m. 4 of the example below.)

When choosing the notes to place in the upper voices above a figured bass, use the bass and figures to determine the pitch classes present in the chord. (When realizing an *unfigured bass*, you must determine appropriate figures before realizing.) If the chord is a four-note chord, use each chord member once, including the bass (exceptions will be noted later). If a chord has three pitch-classes (a triad, for instance), use each pitch-class once, and "double" one of them according to the following principles:

- If the figure is 6/4, 5/3, or other chord of the fifth, double the bass pitch class.  
- If the figure is 6/3 and the bass is a *fixed scale degree* (*do*, *re*, *fa*, or *sol*), double the bass pitch class.  
- If the figure is 6/3 and the bass is a *variable scale degree* (*mi*/*me*, *la*/*le*, or *ti*/*te*) or a chromatically altered pitch, double one of the upper voices at the octave or unison.  
- Generally, do not double a variable scale degree or a chromatically altered pitch.

### Tendency tones

A *tendency tone* is a pitch (class)—usually represented as a scale degree—that tends to progress to some pitch classes more than others. Sometimes this tendency is absolute within a style, but more often it is context-dependent.

The most prominent tendency tones in Western tonal styles are *ti* (not *te*) and *le* (not *la*). 

Generally speaking, when *ti* appears it tends to be followed by *do* in the same voice. In a harmonic context, this tendency is strongest when *ti* occurs in a dominant-functioning chord, and the "resolution" of that tendency comes upon change of function (to tonic or predominant).

Likewise, when *le* appears, it tends to be followed by *sol* in the same voice. This tendency is less dependent on function.

Exceptions to these tendencies include:

- When *ti* is in the middle of a stepwise descent (*re*–*do*–*ti*–*la*–*sol*, for example), it can progress down by step. (Note that *step inertia* here diminishes the effect of an "unresolved" tendency tone. Because there are two conflicting tendencies in play, in this case, either can be "resolved" unproblematically.)  
- When *ti* is in an inner voice, it can progress down to *sol* if necessary to accomplish good voice-leading in the other voices and ensure complete chords. This is called a *frustrated leading-tone*.  
- When *ti* is a functional dissonance of a tonic-functioning chord (see below) it should progress down by step.

### Functional dissonances

Some tendencies, such as the tendency for *le* to progress down, are relatively context-independent. Others are heavily contextualized. The primary contextual tendency for how melodic notes progress is the concept of *functional dissonance*.

Keep in mind from the [Harmonic functions resource](harmonicFunctions.html) that chords tend to cluster in one of three functional groups (**T**, **P**, or **D**) When pitches fuse into a chord expressing one of these three functions, the pitches that comprise that have certain tendencies of progression that they may or may not have in other contexts.

Following are the scale degrees which act as dissonances for their respective functions:

| function	| dissonances	|
| -: | :-: |
| T or Tx	| 7, 5 when 6 is also present	
| P	| 3, 1 when 2 is also present
| D	| 4, 6

In purely diatonic music (triads and seventh chords, no chromatics), these will include *the seventh of every seventh chord*, *the fifth of viiº or VII* (*fa*), and *the fifth of III or iii* (*ti/te*).

Keep in mind that only sometimes do these functional dissonances express themselves in chords or intervals that are acoustically dissonant. However, they do introduce a degree of tension that, like an acoustically dissonant interval in species counterpoint, requires a smooth introduction and a specific resolution.

When one of these scale degrees is present in a chord with the corresponding function, the dissonant scale degree has a strong tendency to *resolve down by step over the next change in function*. In strict composition, we will *always* follow these tendencies. 

In strict keyboard style, these functional dissonances should be "prepared" (approached) by common tone or by step. Thus, though they are proper members of the chord, melodically they will look like one of the three dissonance types of species counterpoint: a *passing tone* or *neighbor tone* dissonance that is approached by step, or a *suspension* dissonance that is approached by a common tone. The suspension type is preferred.

Once a functional dissonance is introduced, it must be resolved down by step in the same voice when the function changes. The dissonance can also be *transferred* to another voice before resolution—for instance, if there are multiple chords in a row exhibiting the same function, a dissonance that appears in the alto can be transferred to the tenor in the following chord, and then resolve in the tenor when the function changes. (It is more typical, and smoother sounding, to transfer dissonances between inner voices or from an inner voice to an outer voice than from an outer voice to an inner voice. Once a dissonance appears in the melody or bass, where it is more noticeable, it tends to resolve in that voice.)

Functional dissonance resolutions often cause conflicts with other principles of voice leading. Except in special cases such as *schemata* (standard patterns that are common enough to sound appropriate, even if they follow different rules), the functional dissonance resolution takes precedence over other principles such as the *law of the shortest way*, contrary motion with the bass, and preferring common tones and steps to melodic leaps. A dissonance resolution is never an excuse for illegal parallels, and only rarely will lead to non-standard doublings.
